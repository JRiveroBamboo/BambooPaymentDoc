### Balance
The _Balance_ is the amount of money settled in your account. For _Payouts_, we have three different types of balances which can be consulted [here]({{< ref "Payout-Balances" >}}).

### Banking Connections
The _Banking Connection_ is the technology that allows us to send money to a payee regardless of the selected payment method.

### FX Service
_Foreign Exchange_ or _FX_ refers to the current rate to convert one country's currency to another. This value is updated according to destination country regulations.  

### Payee
A _Payee_ is a third party who will receive the money result of your Payout request. The information required for a _Payee_ is their name, document, phone, e-mail address, and bank account.

### Payout
_Payout_ refers to the concept of disburse funds to a third party using funds settled in your account.

### Payout fee
Refers to the processing cost of the Payout. This cost can be assumed by you (as Payer) or assumed by the Payee by setting a variable in the request.

### Sanction screening
_Sanction screening_ is the process to let us know if the merchant is making payouts to legally sanctioned persons. This process is important as an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Payout limits control.

The output of this process determines whether the _Payout_ has to be sent to a manual validation.
