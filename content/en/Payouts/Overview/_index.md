## Why using Bamboo Payouts?
Dispersing funds to third parties in Latin American markets is complex. It involves having connections with banks in each country and several legal considerations.

The current model has been a restriction for businesses that do not have local operations and want to pay third parties from other countries.

Bamboo Payouts offers you a payment system to allow mass transfers to third parties, using API or dashboard, with updates on the status of transactions and notifications via e-mail to the you and your third parties.
