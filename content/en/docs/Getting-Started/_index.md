## Overview
Using our platform, you can offer your customers an improved payment experience, being able to request card details as if they were on your page or mobile application through our [**Checkout Form**]({{< ref "Checkout-Form.md" >}}).

You can also request the data only once and store a _**token**_ associated with the card the customer entered securely on our platform.

### PCI-DSS
Our certified **PCI-DSS Level 1** platform allows us to process card numbers and other sensitive customer authentication data.

You can embed the [Checkout Form]({{< ref "Checkout-Form.md" >}}) in your pages or mobile applications; you can now accept payments without receiving confidential information such as customer data, provide security to your customers, and ease of use.
