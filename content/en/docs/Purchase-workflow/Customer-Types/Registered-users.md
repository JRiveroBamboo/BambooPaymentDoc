The customer will receive a _CommerceToken_ after registering their card, which they can use for future transactions. Below are the steps to purchase as a registered user on the website.

## Create a Customer
The first step is to create the customer in Bamboo Payment. To do so, you must invoke a **POST** request to the following URLs according to your needs.

* **Production**: `https://secure-api.bamboopayment.com/v1/api/customer`
* **Stage**: `https://secure-api.stage.bamboopayment.com/v1/api/customer`

#### Response example

```json
{
    "Response": {
        "CustomerId": 249205,
        "Created": "2023-08-22T11:26:53.343",
        "CommerceCustomerId": null,
        "Owner": "Commerce",
        "Email": "kristeldyoder@teleworm.us",
        "Enabled": true,
        "ShippingAddress": null,
        "BillingAddress": {
            "AddressId": 373151,
            "AddressType": 1,
            "Country": "Uruguay",

        "PaymentProfiles": [],
        "CaptureURL": "https://api.stage.bamboopayment.com/Capture/",
        "UniqueID": "UI_b53cb8db-771e-4622-a5db-0e58e156f192",
        "URL": "https://api.stage.bamboopayment.com/api/Customer/249205",

        "PhoneNumber": "093000000",
        "ExternalValue": null
    },
    "Errors": []
}
```

### Customer operations
Once you have created a user, you can perform operations to get or update a customer's information.

#### Get a customer
You can get a customer's information using their Id or email address.

To do so, you must invoke a **GET** request to the following URLs according to your needs.

* **Production**: `https://secure-api.bamboopayment.com/v1/api/customer`
* **Stage**: `https://secure-api.stage.bamboopayment.com/v1/api/customer`

<div id="shortTable"></div>

| | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Get by _Customer Id_ | `/{{customer-id}}` |
| Get by _Customer email_ | `/GetCustomerByEmail?email={{EmailAddress}}` |

In response, you will get a list with the same object returned when [creating a customer](#response-example). Example:

```json
{
    "Response": [
        {
            "CustomerId": 249205,
            "Created": "2023-08-22T14:26:53.343",
            "CommerceCustomerId": null,
            "Owner": "Commerce",
            "Email": "kristeldyoder@teleworm.us",
            "Enabled": true,
            "ShippingAddress": null,
            "BillingAddress": {
                "AddressId": 373151,
                "AddressType": 1,
                "Country": "Uruguay",
                "State": "Montevideo",
                "AddressDetail": "100",
                "PostalCode": null,
                "City": "Montevideo"
            },
            "Plans": null,
            "AdditionalData": null,
            "PaymentProfiles": [],
            "CaptureURL": "https://api.stage.bamboopayment.com/Capture/",
            "UniqueID": "UI_61109a7f-5414-4424-8654-18c30060cd2b",
            "URL": "https://api.stage.bamboopayment.com/api/Customer/249205",
            "FirstName": "Kristel",
            "LastName": "Yoder",
            "DocNumber": "31130749",
            "DocumentTypeId": 2,
            "PhoneNumber": "093000000",
            "ExternalValue": null
        }
    ],
    "Errors": []
}
```

#### Update a customer
To update the information of a customer, you must invoke a **POST** request to the following URLs according to your needs.

* **Production**: `https://secure-api.bamboopayment.com/v1/api/customer/{{{{customer-id}}}}/update`
* **Stage**: `https://secure-api.stage.bamboopayment.com/v1/api/customer/{{customer-id}}/update`

Where `{{customer-id}}` is the id generated when you created the user. Include in the body, the [parameters](#request-parameters) you want to update for the user.

As response, you will get the same object returned when [creating a customer](#response-example).

## Capture the Card Data
The next step is to get the token of the customer’s card. To do so, you can invoke the Card Enrollment or use [Direct tokenization]({{< ref "Direct-Tokenization.md" >}}) if your commerce is PCI-compliant.

{{% alert title="Info" color="info"%}}
If you use the Alternative payment method identifier, you don't require this step and must include the **PaymentMediaId**.
{{% /alert %}}

### Invoking the Card Enrollment
The following sequence diagram explains the Card Enrollment flow.




### Using Direct tokenization
Since the user is not registered in your commerce, you must invoke the method to [create the token for registered users]({{< ref "Direct-Tokenization.md" >}}#CT).


{{% alert title="Note" color="warning"%}}
You should keep the information of the _CommerceToken_ private because it represents a captured card that anyone can use for multiple transactions.
{{% /alert %}}

## Create a Basic Purchase
The token just obtained must be sent from the browser or the mobile app to the application server to create the purchase transaction.

From the server, invoke the [Create a Purchase]({{< ref "Purchase-Operations.md" >}}#create-a-purchase), including the `Purchase` object with the token and other transaction data.

```json
{
  "TrxToken": "CT_kYv0qTHckRiZ4wjCz5NguZRuwFLSIrQc4jiYpVJ8SzQ_",
  "Order": "17030613595101621fb",
  "Amount": 123456,
  "Currency": "USD",
  "Capture": true,
  "TargetCountryISO":"CL",
  "PaymentMediaId":106
}
```
<br>

The **PaymentMediaId** and **TrxToken** fields are optional, but sending one is mandatory, depending on the flow you want to use.

* **PaymentMediaId**: Alternative payment method identifier (transfer, cash, and processing that requires customer redirection). You can obtain this identifier by consulting the [Payment Methods by country](/docs/payment-methods.html) section.

* **TrxToken**: You can generate the token and transact by sending it in this field.

## Recurring Purchases in One Click
After customers register correctly, some cards allow certain transactions without needing a Verification Code (CVV), which allows a more agile user experience (payments in one click). In these cases, purchases can be sent directly without requesting more information from the customer, as explained in the previous point, [Basic purchase](#create-a-basic-purchase).

You must request the Verification Code every time for transactions where the card does not support this feature, as we cannot store it on our servers.

## Verification Code Request Flow
For the Payment Cards that require the entry of the Verification Code in all transactions, we designed the following workflow:

![PrintScreen](/assets/VerificationCodeRequestFlow_en.png)

1. The customer, identified correctly on the Commerce website, initiates the payment process of a purchase using a card previously registered and associated with their account.

2. The merchant page submits the data to the web server to prepare the information sent to Bamboo Payment.

3. The merchant’s Web Server sends the purchase through the BambooPayment API, identifying the _CommerceToken_ as the Payment Method the customer selects.

4. We carry out a series of validations; in this case, we verify if the payment method chosen allows the execution of transactions without the Verification Code. The selected Payment method does not support this functionality in this flow, so the transaction can only be completed once the Card Verification Code has been obtained.

5. We return the Purchase object in _Pending_ status as a response, indicating that some action is needed to complete the process. The `Purchase` object returned will also contain the `CommerceAction` object that describes the necessary steps to be performed by the merchant.

![PrintScreen](/assets/CVVRequestFlow.png)

The merchant must store the pending purchase information (at least the `PurchaseId` for future validations) and process the CommerceAction information to determine the required action. Take into consideration the following properties in this scenario:

* **ActionReason**: Will have the value `VERIFICATION_CODE_NEEDED` because the purchase requires this Verification Code.
* **ActionType**: This field will have the value **2** corresponding to the action `PWCapture`, a function of the javascript component `PWCheckout` that allows to process this type of actions.
* **ActionURL**: This field specifies the URL that you must send as parameter to the `PWCapture` method of the `PWCheckout` component.

6. The merchant’s web page must show the Verification Code request form to the client using the `PWCapture` method as shown here:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  PWCheckout.PWCapture(url);
</script>
```
<br>

Where the value of the `url` parameter corresponds to the `ActionURL` field of the received `Capture` object. 

7. The customer will see the iframe with the Capture Form, which in this case will be presented showing the masked card number (only the last four digits) and a text field for the entry of the Verification Code.

![PrintScreen](/assets/CVVCaptureForm.png)

8. The customer enters the Verification Code of the card used to create the purchase.

9. The verification code the customer enters is sent directly to the Bamboo Payment servers, where it's used to create the authorization message.

10. Bamboo Payment sends the authorization message to the corresponding acquirer with the complete data. 

11. Bamboo Payment processes the acquirer’s response and updates the purchase status according to this response.

12. Bamboo Payment generates a notification to the merchant, informing the **Purchase** object and its final status determined by the authorization process. The **Purchase** sent is the same previously answered in step 5, the merchant should validate the information received (at least the `PurchaseId` matches the expected one). This notification is sent to the **WebHook** service the merchant must implement to obtain the different notifications generated by Bamboo Payment. 

## Notification Alternative
In addition to the option to receive a notification from Bamboo Payment at the end of the purchase process (step 12 of the normal flow), an alternative flow can be executed to explicitly query the result of the purchase once it is detected that the pending process has finished (after step 5).

![PrintScreen](/assets/VerificationCodeRequestFlow2_en.png)

This flow uses the functionalities implemented in the **PWCheckout** JavaScript library to inform the completion of the pending purchase process.

The steps related to this flow are listed below and explained; the initial stages before 12 are the same as those previously described.

12. Once the pending process has finished, the **PWCheckout** library receives a notification of the status of the process. 

13. The **PWCheckout** library triggers the `notificationReceived` event. The merchant must subscribe previously to the event through the **Bind** method in the following way:

```html
<script type="text/javascript"> 
  PWCheckout.Bind("notificationReceived", NotificationHandler);
</script>
```
<br>

The merchant must implement the **NotificationHandler** function (the name is just an example), which will receive information about the final state of the process.

Example of the function for handling notifications:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    function NotificationHandler(notification) {
        if (notification.ProcessStatus == 1) {
            //Process OK
        } else {
            //Process with errors
        }
    }
</script>
```
<br>

The `ProcessStatus` field of the received notification will determine the final state of the process. The possible values are:

* **OK** (value 1) – The process finished successfully.
* **Pending** (value 2) – The process is still pending.
* **Error** (value 3) – The process ended in error.

14. After the web page receives the `notificationReceived` event, it may continue with the flow. 

15. The merchant must invoke a GET call from the web server to the BambooPayment Purchase API, querying the `PurchaseId` previously stored in step 5.

For this, the call is made: HTTP/GET (server to server):

`{environment_api}/v1/api/purchase/{purchase-id} `

16. The Bamboo Payment response will contain the `Purchase` object with a status other than _Pending_ (depending on the result of the transaction), so it can be processed as a regular purchase response.

For this, the call is made: HTTP/POST (server to server):

`{environment_api}/v1/api/purchase`
