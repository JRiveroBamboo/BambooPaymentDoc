We implemented The Bamboo Payment API using REST services and JSON format (Content-Type: `application/json`) for message exchange. 

You must make every API call using `HTTPS` (`TLS 1.3`) and handle each operation's HTTP response code to determine the processing status of the sent transaction.

## Customer Type
You can have either Anonymous or Registered customers regardless of the flow type. Anonymous customers are not registered on the site and make a one-time purchase. The registered customers are shoppers registered on the website, so they can be identified and have extra functionalities such as recurrences.

## Flow type
You can use two different workflows to authorize a purchase:

* API
* Redirect

{{% alert title="Note" color="info"%}}
Flow type depends on each payment method. Itâ€™s specified in the [payment methods table by country](/en/docs/getting-started/payment-methods.html) in the column _**FLOW**_.
{{% /alert %}}

### API flow
Upon invoking the API to initiate a purchase, the invocation response will directly provide a status, which could be either final or partial.

For purchases using API, you can use any of the following options:

* [Purchase creation]({{< ref "Purchase-Operations.md" >}}), which can be local or CrossBorder.
* [Direct purchase]({{< ref "Direct-Purchase.md" >}})
* [Purchase preview]({{< ref "Purchase-Preview.md" >}})

### Redirect flow
When you invoke the API to initiate a purchase, you obtain a _CommerceAction_. This _CommerceAction_ signals that the Merchant needs to take necessary steps to advance the payment process. In such instances, the API returns a URL linked to the _CommerceAction_ to direct the customer to this URL for further payment continuation.
